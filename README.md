##Coursera Course :Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project ( Week-4)

## Description

This repo is a peer-gradded assignment submission for the Coursera course's project (Getting and Cleaning Data course project). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The Dataset is related to human activities such as walking, standing etc.. This code downloads the dataset from the website, extracts the desired info and analyses the data.

###Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

###Files

1. CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the dataset and all steps performed to clean the and analyse the data

2. run_analysis.R performs the data operations as requested in the course projectâ€™s. They are 5 requested steps:

   -Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

   -Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

   -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

   -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

   -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. TidyDataSet.txt is the exported final requested tidy data
